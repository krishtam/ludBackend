# Optional: Add environment variables for tests
# For example, to ensure a specific settings file is used or to signal test mode:
# env =
#   APP_ENV=test
#   TESTING=True
#   SECRET_KEY=your_test_secret_key_if_different_from_default_or_not_mocked
#   DATABASE_URL=sqlite://:memory: # Though conftest.py handles DB URL for Tortoise directly
#
# Note: Environment variables set here are available during the test session.
# If your app.core.config.Settings loads values from environment variables,
# these can be used to control application settings during tests.
# However, for database URL, conftest.py directly configures Tortoise,
# which is more explicit for test DB setup. The SECRET_KEY might be relevant
# if not mocked in security tests.
# For now, keeping it simple as conftest handles DB and security tests use app's settings.
# If settings were more complex (e.g., different for test vs. dev), env vars here would be useful.
